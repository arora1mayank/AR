We aim to provide a platform where we could communicate, learn the cutting-edge data science tech, and identify the key challenges as well as opportunities interdisciplinary areas. We wish to create an environment where our members can generate new ideas and be more creative not only in research but also in real-world applications. At present, we focus on augmented reality and optimization methods that could bridge that gap between quantitative analysis and industry applications. We regularly hold seminars organize discussions on these topics with professors in related fields and would raise interesting projects for members to get hands on experience."
